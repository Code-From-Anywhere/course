# Become a frontend dev

I strongly suggest not to do the whole course. I think that now you already know enough to become a front-end developer. Seriously, that's all you need to know! Just go get a job so you can use your knowledge in practice.

Bye bye!

You can get a job, but don't stop learning! If you want to become a wizard, continue with this course. Finish it! Make something amazing, something you're passionate about!

However, It doesn't hurt to plan in some interviews for front-end jobs. I bet you can get some offers ðŸ’°! You don't need to accept any offer, it's just good to know you're able to get them already.

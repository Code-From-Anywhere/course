# Going full stack

Let's go full stack baby! Yes, that's right.

Please read the [sensible docs](https://sensiblestack.com) because in this documentation I am working with sensible. It's a framework for full stack typescript development, so it will make everything super easy for you! Oh, and... I've made that too.

Just read the [about page](https://sensiblestack.com/docs/about/) and the [tech landscape](https://sensiblestack.com/docs/about/tech-landscape) and come back here.

## Setting it up

Run and follow the instructions

```bash
npx sensible
```

# Deploying with expo

Once you shared the UI with react-with-native your app should also work fine on native cross-platform mobile with sensible's built-in `expo` support.

The short version is coming soon...

For now, I'll just connect you to the [expo docs](https://docs.expo.dev/distribution/introduction/). You should read them anyway, they're great!

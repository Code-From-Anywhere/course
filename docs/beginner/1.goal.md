# Setting a goal

The first step is deciding what you want to get out of this course. It's very important that you're not only going to read the stuff I say here on these pages. You need to practice in order to become handy.

**How many hours a week are you going to study?**
This is an important question. Commit to it, tell your friends, and set a goal. This course will take about a month to complete when you do it full-time. Make a plan, and set a goal where you want to be after this course.

**What are you going to make?**

This course is meant to be interactive. I teach you something, you try to apply it. But for that you need to have some idea in mind. What are you going to build?

- In the **beginner** section, you will learn how to make simple styled websites. You won't learn anything with user interaction yet though, but you can play with different topics if you want.

- In the **Frontend** section, among other things you will learn the basics of typescript and react, and you will deploy your app to a domain! What do you want your app to be about? You can start writing some pages here already

- In the **Full-stack** section, you will get the full picture and you can start making full-stack apps. What do you want your app to be able to do? It can be anything!

- In the **Wizard** section, you will learn super advanced topics. You'll learn there are many applications of these things.

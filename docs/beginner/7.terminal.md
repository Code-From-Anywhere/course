# Knowing your terminal

Important commands (I'll explain later, in the meantime you can google yourself. This should be second nature for you)

- **`cd "path"`** go into another folder. Use `cd ..` to go up a folder
- **`ls`** show contents of current folder
- **`pwd`** show where you are (print working directory)
- **`z`** go to any folder anywhere really quickly ([repo](https://github.com/agkozak/zsh-z))
- **`rm`** remove a file or folder ([manual](https://ss64.com/bash/rm.html))
- **`mv`** move a file or folder ([manual](https://ss64.com/bash/mv.html))
- **`cp`** copy a file or folder ([manual](https://ss64.com/bash/cp.html))
- **`mkdir`** make a new directory
- **`touch`** make a new file
- **`echo "text"`** print something
- **`say "text"`** say something

I think the following commands are also very useful. However, as a beginner you don't need to know everything. Just come back to this later...

- grep
- head
- tail
- man
- cat
- `>`
- `|`
- chmod
- exit
- clear
- kill
- alias
- `$`
- `"`
- `'`
- functions
- `&&`
- `||`
- `(` and `)`
- `;`
- say
- conditionals

## Oh my ZSH

Oh my ZSH is a handy extension that changes your terminal. You can also install plugins. I recommend using [ZSH](https://ohmyz.sh/) with the [autosuggest extension](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions) for the most productive terminal usage.

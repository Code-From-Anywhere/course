# Make something!

Now that you know the basics... Go and make something cool! You can use html in `.html` files, markdown in `.md` files, css in the style attrubute of your html tags (or use a `.css` file), json files have the `.json` extension...

Can you make a nice little website about yourself? Or any other topic you like? Be creative!

Open the editor and get going :-) I'd love to see what you've made!

Can you stop using all other file formats that you currently use and start using only these ones that I tought you about? You'll be a wizard in no-time this way!

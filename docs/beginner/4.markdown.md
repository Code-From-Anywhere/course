# Markdown

Markdown is a handy way to write documents. You can save any file as a `[filename].md` file to create a markdown file. It uses a couple of syntactic rules that let you style things.

Here is a cheatsheet.

```md
Styling:
**bold** bold text
_italic_ italic text

Titles:

# H1 title

## H2 title

### H3 title

This is how you create a link:

[link to google](https://google.nl)

This is how you show an image:

![image alt text](../cfa-team.jpeg)
```

## Frontmatter

There is also frontmatter, some lines at the beginning of the markdown file to save some parameters, often metadata about the markdown file.

An example of frontmatter:

```md
---
variable1: true
---
```

There are some more things you can do in markdown, but it's not important

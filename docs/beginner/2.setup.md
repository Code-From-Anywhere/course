# Setting things up

To start developing, I recommend the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor. I recommand having a Mac but it's not needed. It'd also be good to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) already, but you'll only need that in the "frontend" section.

## Your terminal is your friend

You should get good at navigating in your terminal. We have a section about this because it's key to be a productive developer. At least make sure you know what [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is and how to open a terminal...

## Using `sensible setup`

If you want to be quick, `sensible setup` installs all tools for you that we recommend you to have. This cli only works with Mac.

After you've installed node, just run the following command:

```bash
npx sensible setup
```

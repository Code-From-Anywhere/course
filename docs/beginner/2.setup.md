# Setting things up

To start developing, I recommend the [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) editor. I recommand having a Mac but it's not needed. It'd also be good to install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) already, but you'll only need that in the "frontend" section.

## Using `sensible setup`

If you want to be quick, `sensible setup` installs all tools for you that we recommend you to have. This cli only works with Mac.

After you've installed node, just run the following command:

```bash
npx sensible setup
```

## The terminal is your friend

You should get good at navigating in your terminal. We have a section about this because it's key to be a productive developer. At least make sure you know what [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) is and how to open a terminal...

## VSCode is your home

There are many features in this editor. If you've used the `sensible setup` command, a lot of extensions have already been installed for you. A good start would be learning some common shortcuts in VSCode by hard, because you're going to need them a lot.

Along with the more [standard MacOS keybindings](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201236), these are the shortcuts I use all the time (MacOS).

- Open/close terminal: `Control + backtick`
- Open new terminal tab: `Command + backslash`
- Search file: `Command + P`
- Search VSCode Command: `Command + Shift + P`
- Open/close sidebar: `Command + B`
- Open explorer: `Command + shift + E`
- Open global search: `Command + shift + F`
- Close all files except unsaved ones: `Command + K U`

Seriously, you'll save so much time knowing these commands, so please learn them by hard, right now!

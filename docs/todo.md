## Structure

Details sections:

- Challenges / Let's do this (Nike)
- Wizard Stuff
- More details / Background (Mostly outward links)
- Not to do list

## Ideas

- [ ] From Zero to Heron? Remove the wizard stuff?
- [ ] Translate to top 10 languages using Google Translate controller
- [ ] Blog controller
- [ ] `<Video page="folder/path/page-slug" location="x.y.z(section)">` prints a video if it's available for the selected presentor
- [ ] `<Todo><li>x</li><li>y</li><li>z</li></Todo>` for user to mark todos. Connected to localStorage or account
- [ ] `<Ads page="folder/path/page-slug" location="header|footer|banner" />` Cross-promoting ourselves! Exclusive content, Services, Social media posts, Blogs, Chat. Incentivise sharing of anything #CodeFromAnywhere related.
- [ ] Leveled distribution engine
- [ ] User Credit System with purchase and doing other things for them
- [ ] Add limits to content consumption when credit runs out
- [ ] Newsletter
- [ ] Make the course more reachable (offline, electron, expo, vscode, chrome)
- [ ] Community: Currenlty it's all in slack. This is already great. In the end, we need to move this more to the front so google can pick it up. The amount of communication that's that's not traceable should be minimised. It would be a lot of fun to create a social network on top of the Docusaurus, but I'm not sure that's the right place. But a plugable Content Creation CMS x King OS thingy that syncs with github would be amazing, and it would also be compatible with Docusaurus so that's great.
- [ ] Job marketplace (see below)

## Don't do this

- Setup a hierarchy using the Category type so I can CRUD new sections easily (use fs as base to generate hierarchy)
- Move away from docusaurus once my own md site generator is ready

## Job marketplace

Once we really get a big audience of developers, we'll see 2 things:

1. developers are looking for better opportunities
2. companies will see there are a lot of developers here

We can offer developers to be found more easily by companies by sharing their details with them. We can set up multiple channels (King OS) where all info of all developers (using their privacy policy) is shared.

Those developers don't need king OS themselves anymore, we do the marketing of them for them. It's abstracted away. Much better for the POC!

All companies traffic go to codefromanywhere.com because of the free resource of developer information.

This should not be our main source of income though. It doesn't matter. We will find a way once we provide so much value.

We should uphold our standards though, that's really important! A company can only post a job here if it aligns well enough with our philosophy.

This thing can already be made, we can start experimenting with it without giving it a menu on the site. It's a behind-the-scenes process we use King OS for.

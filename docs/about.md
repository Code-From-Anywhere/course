# Code From Anywhere Course

> This course is a work in progress... Check back soon!

Hi! In this course you will learn how to make full-stack apps. This course focusses on the stuff you REALLY need to know. We don't go super deep and tell you all the details, we just help you to go from beginner to wizard in under a month, so you can start building full-stack applications and make money with your side-projects!

The course contains 5 sections

- **Beginner**: All the basics you need to know before you can "ship" something
- **Frontend**: The basics to quickly ramp you up to being a frontend developer
- **Full Stack**: The basics to quickly ramp you up to being a full-stack developer that can make both mobile apps and websites!
- **Wizard** The ultimate goal of this course is showing you the real magic that we'll explain in this section. Will you be the next Wizard?
- **Lifestyle** Here we'll talk about what you can do with all of this info you can learn here. Among other things, we'll talk about finance, freedom, entrepeneurship, and becoming a wizard.

Once you're done with this course, you'll be able to make apps (simple versions of things like Facebook, GitHub, Uber, Medium, or whatever) in a matter of weeks. If you are able to achieve wizardry this could even be days.

## What's Code From Anywhere?

We're a software development agency with developers from all over the world. We decided to build a course to share the way we work and make full-stack apps super quickly.

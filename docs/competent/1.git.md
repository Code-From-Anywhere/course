# Git

Git is needed for version control, deployment, and for collaboration in a team.
The most important things you need to know about git are the following:

## Pushing your changes

This is how to add something to git

```bash
git add filePath
```

To add all stuff you changed, you can just do `git add .` for simplicity

After adding your files to your staged files, you need to commit them. It can be done with the following command

```bash
git commit -M 'your message'
```

This will commit your changes, ready to be pushed to your remote repository.

After adding and committing, all that's left is to push.

```bash
git push
```

## Pulling

```bash
git pull
```

This fetches changes on the repo on your branch

## Changing branch

You can easily change your branch with the following command

```bash
git branch -M branchname
```

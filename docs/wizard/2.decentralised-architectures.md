# Decentralised architectures

At Code From Anywhere it's our goal to create enable developers to create the next wave of applications that could transform the internet as we know it. Some people call it web3, but I guess we're all still trying to understand what web3 has to become.

We think web3 should be more decentralised, or, better said, more centralised around human beings, around individuals. Behind the scenes, we are hard at work on creating an architecture that makes it possible to be more in control of your data. We call it [King OS](https://king-os.com).

# Decentralised architectures

At Code From Anywhere it's our goal to enable developers to create the next wave of applications that could transform the internet as we know it. Some people call it web3, but I guess we're all still trying to understand what web3 has to become.

Among other things, we think web3 should be more centralised around individuals, serving them instead of harming them. Behind the scenes, we are hard at work on creating an architecture that makes it possible to be more in control of your data and do more with it. We call it [King OS](https://king-os.com).

In case you're getting excited about this idea and want to contribute... Ask about it in the community!

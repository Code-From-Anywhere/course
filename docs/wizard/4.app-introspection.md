# App introspection

One of the core techniques we used to create Sensible we call **app introspection**. When you use Sensible, we are looking and parsing your typescript files to generate meta data about them. With this we can do many things! To parse typescript, we have been using [tsmorph](https://github.com/dsherret/ts-morph) for this.

We're still reseraching more ways to create smarter app-introspection. For example we didn't do anything about the frontend yet. Also creating documentations, todo tracking, feature requests are high on our list, as well as dependency management.

There's not much I can teach you here, but I just wanted to mention this as I think it's a very promising technique with many many applications.

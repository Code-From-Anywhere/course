# Conventions & standards

As a wizard, you should start thinking about the bigger picture of the long-term performance of the apps you create.

A big factor for success is creating good conventions and standards and keeping the team aligned. Sensible is all about this! We want to help you create those conventions and standards, possibly enforce them, so it will be easier to create quality code.

Currently there aren't many ways yet we found to do this, but if you have some ideas... Don't hestitate to reach out!

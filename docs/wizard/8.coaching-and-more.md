# Coaching & more

If you haven't had enough yet and want to learn more...

## Coaching

I give 1:1 coaching for €250 per hour (currently pretty full, slack me)

## Group Demos & Trainings

I give group sessions about niche topics (any thing covered on this website, but more in-depth) for teams for €1000 per session (±4 hours)

## Early adopters of high-value apps/tools

I'm working on tools, conventions, ideas, frameworks and apps for all topics in these sections. Do you want to be an early adopter? Message me on slack.

## Wizard Team

If you think you got it in you and want to join the Code From Anywhere Wizards team to build great frameworks and tools for developers... Message me on slack.

## Boilerplates

Throughout the years I've built many startups and apps and I own most of the code. I am selling boilerplates that could potentially kickstart your startup. This could be super valuable, so let's have a call to see what you need, and if I can help you with that.

Stay Free!

# Going full stack

Let's go full stack baby! Yes, that's right.

Please read the [sensible docs](https://sensiblestack.com) because in this course we're using sensible. It's a framework for full stack typescript development, so it will make everything super easy for you! Oh, and... I've made that too.

Just read the [about page](https://sensiblestack.com/docs/about/) and the [tech landscape](https://sensiblestack.com/docs/about/tech-landscape) and come back here.

## Installation instructions

1. Make sure you have `brew`, `node`, `npm` and `npx`. If you don't, this is how to install them:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install node
```

On windows, it works a bit differently, just google it if you use windows.

2. call the init command of the cli.

```
npx sensible init
```

3. Follow the instructions on the terminal and wait for the project to be set up

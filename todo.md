# Todo

- Make it possible for users to create social media posts from every page
- Make it possible for trusted CFA members to approve those posts and sort them

**BEGINNER**

- goal: What do you want to share with the world?
- json (json files): arrays, objects, numbers, strings, booleans
- md (md files): headings, styles, links, images
- html: intro, elements (html, head, title, meta, body, h1, h2, p, div, span, a, ul, ol, li, form, input, select, option, img, script), comments
- css (style prop): intro, syntax, selectors, comments, styles (background-color, color (hex)), text-align, font-family, font-size, border, margin, padding, height, width, box model, flexbox model, position, display, z-index, overflow, opacity)
- distribution
- monetisation

**COMPETENT**

- git: github
- ts: const, primitive types, typeof, operators, conditions, comparisons, arrow functions, number methods, string methods, string templates, array methods, object methods, date methods, math, boolean, comments, console.log, reserved words, types
- react, nextjs (compile to html): functional components, props, events, useState, useEffect
- deploy frontend: vercel, domains, dns
- data storage (variable storage, localstorage, json storage, markdown storage, useState, context->useStore)
- tailwind (compile to css): setup, abbreviations
- npm packages
- config: package.json (scripts, (dev)Dependencies, workspaces, eslint, prettier
- distribution
- monetisation

**EXPERT**

- sensible: why, birdseye, setup
- core: why, types, operations, user-actions, endpoints
- server: nodejs intro, lib, cli, api, storage, makeEndpoint
- ui: react-with-native for expo support (cover beginner + competent and show the difference), api
- dev dashboard (docs, recents, errors, api interactions)
- deploy backend: macos nginx, ubuntu nginx
- deploy expo app
- distribution
- monetisation

**WIZARD**

- other environments: vscode, chrome, electron
- decentralised architectures, king-os
- thinking in data
- automation
- metascripting
- typescript introspection
- conventions, standards
- distribution
- monetisation

**IRL**

- finance
- freedom
- entrepreneurship
- become a wizard: create explainer videos in this structure & find students, join code from anywhere

# Later

- Setup a hierarchy using the Category type so I can CRUD new sections easily (use fs as base to generate hierarchy)
- Move away from docusaurus once my own md site generator is ready
- Once my leveled distribution engine is ready, add limits to content consumption with monetisation
- Make it possible to mark a section as done for yourself (device local storage)
- Once my distribution engine is ready, add incentives for people to return to the course (emails, push notifications, etc)
- Make the course more reachable (offline, electron, expo, vscode, chrome)

# Structure

- Every section has "let's do this"-section that tells you the possibilities so you get excited and try them out
- Every section has "wizard stuff"-section to recommend our conventions and ways of working.
- Every section has a "background"-section that provides quality additional resources
- Every section has "share"-buttons that make it easy to share your results with other students in a structured way (use social media). The things you share can also be posted to the website using a form.
- Every section has a "not-to-do-list"-section that shows you the common pitfalls and recommendations of what NOT to do.

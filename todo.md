# Todo

- Make it possible for users to create social media posts from every page
- Make it possible for trusted CFA members to approve those posts and sort them

**WIZARD**

- other environments: vscode, chrome, electron
- decentralised architectures, king-os
- thinking in data
- automation
- metascripting
- typescript introspection
- conventions, standards
- distribution
- monetisation

**IRL**

- finance
- freedom
- entrepreneurship
- become a wizard: create explainer videos in this structure & find students, join code from anywhere

# Later

- Setup a hierarchy using the Category type so I can CRUD new sections easily (use fs as base to generate hierarchy)
- Move away from docusaurus once my own md site generator is ready
- Once my leveled distribution engine is ready, add limits to content consumption with monetisation
- Make it possible to mark a section as done for yourself (device local storage)
- Once my distribution engine is ready, add incentives for people to return to the course (emails, push notifications, etc)
- Make the course more reachable (offline, electron, expo, vscode, chrome)

# Structure

- Every section has "let's do this"-section that tells you the possibilities so you get excited and try them out
- Every section has "wizard stuff"-section to recommend our conventions and ways of working.
- Every section has a "background"-section that provides quality additional resources
- Every section has "share"-buttons that make it easy to share your results with other students in a structured way (use social media). The things you share can also be posted to the website using a form.
- Every section has a "not-to-do-list"-section that shows you the common pitfalls and recommendations of what NOT to do.
